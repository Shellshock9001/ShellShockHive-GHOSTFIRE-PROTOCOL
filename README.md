# 💀 ShellShockHive: GHOSTFIRE PROTOCOL  

## 🎯 MISSION OBJECTIVE

Build the operational capability of a real-world cyber reconnaissance and remote support specialist.  
Master digital surveillance, system exploitation, human tracking, and field-grade tactical infrastructure — while enforcing uncompromising operational security.  
This is an applied training protocol designed for field deployment, not simulation.

---

## 🧩 PHASE 1 — SYSTEMS CONTROL: Master Your Operational Environment  
Before surveillance or intrusion begins, operators must have full control of their systems, shells, and operational tools.

### ✅ 1.1 Linux Mastery: Command-Line Dominance

**Deployment Requirements:**
- Install Kali Linux (bare-metal or dual-boot only).
- Disable GUI login. Operate from TTY terminal (pure CLI).

**Core Skill Targets:**
- `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `xargs` – for log parsing and stream automation  
- `iptables`, `ufw`, `nftables` – for firewall control and packet inspection  
- `journalctl`, `systemctl`, `ps`, `strace` – for process/service auditing  
- `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, `nmap`, `netstat`, `ss` – for traffic and network-level analysis  
- `rsync`, `scp`, `tmux`, `ssh`, `screen`, `ssh-keygen` – for remote and persistent shell management  
- `cron`, `.bashrc`, `aliases`, `~/.config`, `.bash_history` – for automation and command hardening

**Known Friction Points:**
- Understanding `systemd` vs `init.d`  
- Bridging wireless NICs in monitor mode  
- Managing non-standard interface names (`enp0s3`, etc.)

**✅ Required Project: Blackout Node™**
> A USB or Pi-based bootable recon device running:
- Full CLI automation  
- Tor + VPN + DNS obfuscation  
- Encrypted exfil with hidden storage and hardened shell interface

---

## 🔓 PHASE 2 — HACKER OPS: Exploitation, Escalation, and Data Exfiltration  
This phase trains offensive capabilities required for real-world intrusion and persistence.

### ✅ 2.1 Penetration Fundamentals: System Breach Tactics

**Essential Tools:**
- `nmap`, `masscan` — scanning  
- `Burp Suite` — MITM and web app testing  
- `sqlmap`, `hydra`, `john`, `hashcat` — brute force, cracking, credential recovery  
- `Impacket` — Windows enumeration and lateral movement  
- `Metasploit` — custom payload creation only (no GUI exploitation)

**Known Friction Points:**
- Interpreting stealth/filtered ports  
- Modern WAF bypass and SQLi edge cases  
- Defender and AV bypass via `donut`, `nishang`, and obfuscation chains

**✅ Required Project: GhostEntry Toolkit™**
> Modular script set (Python/PowerShell) that:
- Enumerates host  
- Drops AV-evasive payloads  
- Creates persistence via registry/scheduled tasks  
- Extracts and exfiltrates logs, credentials, and local artifacts  
- Deployable via `.bat`, `.ps1`, and `.lnk` stagers

---

## 🛰️ PHASE 3 — DIGITAL TRAIL HUNTER: OSINT & Real-World Target Tracking  
Human targeting and online footprint analysis are core to any off-site field operative.

### ✅ 3.1 OSINT Targeting: People, Devices, Metadata

**Tool Stack:**
- `whatsmyname`, `Maigret`, `Sherlock` – username sweeps  
- `Shodan`, `Censys`, `MaxMind`, `IPQS` – infrastructure and IP tracing  
- `Dehashed`, `BreachForums`, `.zip` combo leaks – credential and breach mining  
- `exiftool`, `mat2`, reverse image tools (Yandex > Google)  
- Real property + legal OSINT (county sites, TLOxp, Spokeo)  
- Wireless device footprinting: `wigle.net`, `bluetoothctl`, `hcitool`

**Known Friction Points:**
- Correlating fragmented social and location data  
- Extracting real identities without triggering alerts  
- Navigating Telegram/BreachForums data safely and lawfully

**✅ Required Project: HunterZero Dashboard™**
> A Python-based dashboard that accepts phone, email, or handle as input and returns:
- Social footprint  
- Breach history  
- Wireless trail  
- Address & photo metadata  
- Modular plugins for integrating new data sources

---

## 🛰️ PHASE 4 — FIELD OPS TECH: Remote Tactical Infrastructure  
Real-world field agents require covert, encrypted, live remote support — not post-facto log reviews.

### ✅ 4.1 Tactical Remote Infrastructure

**Systems to Build and Master:**
- `Tailscale`, `Zerotier`, `Wireguard` — stealth mesh networking  
- `Frp`, `Ngrok` — port-forwarding internal hosts  
- `MeshCentral` — covert remote surveillance/control  
- `Ghidra`, `IDA`, `radare2` — firmware + binary analysis  
- SDR: `gqrx`, `rtl_433`, `URH` — for RF + wireless tracking

**Known Friction Points:**
- Bypassing NAT and CG-NAT firewalls  
- Maintaining persistence through reboots  
- Handling unreliable uplinks (mobile, satellite, tethered)

**✅ Required Project: Overwatch Core™**
> Raspberry Pi or hardened laptop system capable of:
- Secure connection to agent device  
- Remote stream access (mic, cam, GPS)  
- Encrypted file relay  
- Automated kill-switch  
- QR-code or USB-based stealth launch

---

## 🔐 PHASE 5 — OPSEC & OFF-GRID DEPLOYMENT  
All skills are nullified if traceable. This phase focuses on encryption, compartmentalization, and full trace erasure.

### ✅ 5.1 Secure Comms, Storage, & Execution

**Critical Tools & Systems:**
- `gpg`, `age`, `openssl`, `veracrypt` — file and message encryption  
- `tails`, `Qubes OS` — for disposable or compartmentalized operations  
- Metadata/forensic cleaners: `mat2`, `exiftool`, `bleachbit`  
- Dead drop logic: Pastebin rotators, gist vaults, onion-based dead-letter boxes

**Known Friction Points:**
- Misusing keyrings / revocation certs  
- Hidden leaks via document metadata, EXIF, or temp files  
- Over-complicating workflows and reducing op efficiency

**✅ Required Project: Vanishing Kit™**
> Self-erasing USB/SD toolkit with:
- Hardened Linux build  
- Auto-wipe triggers (password fail, reboot count, device mismatch)  
- Secure apps (Tutanota, Proton, Tox, Signal CLI)  
- Recon + radio + metadata tools preloaded

## 💼 PHASE 6 — PORTFOLIO DEPLOYMENT & JOB-TIER SHOWCASE  
Demonstrating operational skill is non-negotiable. The final build merges tracking, intrusion, and support capabilities into a deployable stack.

### ✅ FINAL PROJECT: BlackSignal™ OPS STACK

> A full-stack, web-accessible cyber-ops console with:

- Flask or FastAPI backend, React/Next frontend  
- Modules for:
  - Remote system scanning  
  - OSINT people tracker  
  - Payload creation & deployment  
  - SSID and Bluetooth mapping  
  - AES + Tor drop vault  
  - QR-based deployable OS bootstrap

**Deployment Requirements:**
